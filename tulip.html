        <p>Tulips are among the world's favorite flowers, whether to grow, gift, receive, photograph, paint or display - and one of the most recognized. The classic egg shaped blooms add elegance & sophistication to the garden or the vase. But tulips offer so much more than this, with extraordinary flower forms, unfolding stars, ruffles, peony forms, lily forms, fringes, bunches & fragrance!</p>
        <p>The most common meaning for tulips is perfect or deep love. Because tulips are one of the first flowers to bloom in the spring, they can mean rebirth. Victorians often associated tulips with charity.</p>
