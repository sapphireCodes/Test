        <h1>Lotus</h1>

        <p>The lotus flower is one of the most ancient & deepest symbols of our planet. The lotus flower grows in muddy water & rises above the surface to bloom with remarkable beauty. At night the flower closes and sinks underwater, at dawn it rises & opens again. Untouched by the impurity, lotus symbolizes the purity of heart & mind. The lotus flower represents long life, health, honor and good luck.</p>
        <p>The roots of a lotus are in the mud, the stem grows up through the water, and the heavily scented flower lies pristinely above the water, basking in the sunlight. This pattern of growth signifies the progress of the soul from the primeval mud of materialism, through the waters of experience, and into the bright sunshine of enlightenment.</p>
